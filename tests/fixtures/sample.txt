STM32F407 Errata Summary

ES0182 Rev 14 — Known silicon bugs for STM32F407/417.

Section 2.1.8: SPI CRC
The SPI CRC calculation is not reliable in slave mode
at frequencies above 18 MHz. Workaround: use software CRC.

Section 2.5.1: I2C analog filter
The analog noise filter may cause false BUSY detection
after a NACK on some I2C instances. Workaround: toggle PE bit.

Special characters: µs delay, 25°C ambient, 100Ω termination
